👋 Hi There,

My name is Prabhat. I’m a software engineer by profession, mostly working on ML infrastructure [@DeepEdge](https://www.deepedge.ai/).

My technical interests include software design, databases, distributed systems, machine learning, and backend infrastructure. And I enjoy working with Python stack and Go.

My blog is a platform to share my experiences, interests, introspection and current progress with programming. In addition, I hope to become a better writer by blogging.

When I'm not hacking away on a project, I enjoy watching tv series, anime, writing, learning new things, and working out.
