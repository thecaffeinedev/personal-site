This year, I set out to explore more of India, starting with the charming coastal town of Pondicherry. Here's how my adventure unfolded:

## Arrival and Accommodation

When we arrived in Pondicherry, we headed straight to our hotel in Whitetown. Our friendly hotel owner recommended a great place to rent a scooter - a decision that made our trip so much easier! For just ₹300 a day, we had the freedom to roam around town.

## Day 1: French Charm and Spiritual Vibes

Our first day was action-packed:

1. We started off with lunch at the Coromandel Cafe, it was really nice.
2. Next, we explored a nearby church.
3. A visit to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram was particularly special for me, having attended Sri Aurobindo School in the past.
4. Later, we rode our scooty to Auroville, about 9-10 km from Whitetown. The Matrimandir, a massive golden sphere, was an impressive sight to see.
5. We ended our evening at Rock Beach. Despite the crowds, the lively atmosphere was enjoyable.
6. Dinner at a nearby restaurant rounded off a perfect first day.

## Day 2: Beach Life and Water Adventures

Our second day was all about embracing the coastal vibe:

1. We started with croissants at a French bakery, but then we were craving some Indian food. So we went to Surguru Restaurant for some poori and dosa.
2. The highlight was undoubtedly the water activities at Pondy Ocean Park near Paradise Beach. It was an absolute blast!
3. After all that fun in the water, we were starving. We had a late lunch at Bayfield Restaurant.
4. We ended our trip watching the sunset at Eden Beach. It was beautiful - the perfect end to our Pondicherry adventure.


## Reflections

Looking back, renting that scooter was our best decision. It allowed us to easily explore everything from the old French buildings to the beautiful beaches.

The food scene in Pondicherry is not to be missed. We tried everything from fancy cafes to local joints. My advice? Try both the French cafes and the South Indian eateries - it's all delicious!

Despite a few hiccups with our onward journey to Kodaikanal (including a two-hour wait in the summer heat for our delayed bus), our time in Pondicherry left us with wonderful memories.

As we boarded our bus to Kodaikanal, we felt a tinge of sadness leaving Pondicherry behind. However, we were also excited about our upcoming adventure in Kodaikanal.

## Final Thoughts

If you're considering a trip to Pondicherry, I wholeheartedly recommend it! With its great food, beautiful beaches, and fascinating mix of cultures, it's a unique destination. Just remember to rent a scooter, sample all the cuisines, and don't miss those beautiful beach sunsets!
