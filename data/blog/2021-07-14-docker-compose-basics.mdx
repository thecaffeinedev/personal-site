# Getting started with Docker Compose

_NOTE: This isn‚Äôt a Docker tutorial. It assumes you to have a basic knowledge of Docker and the problems it solves._

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and managing applications which consist of multiple Docker containers.

To begin with, let‚Äôs create some working directories;

```bash
mkdir docker_compose_basics
cd docker_compose_basics
mkdir api web
```

Before we get started on the Docker stuff, we will create two simple applications; an API and a web server. I‚Äôve chosen to write the API in [Go](https://golang.org/) and the web server in [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to keep things interesting. All the code is provided so don‚Äôt worry if you are unfamiliar with these are technologies.

### 1) JSON API

**1.1) Writing a simple API in Go**

Go inside the `API` directory and create a file named `api.go`

In this file we will define some structures and hardcode some data. The¬† `main` function simply listens to the root path on port 80 and returns a JSON response containing all the data in response to all requests.I hardcoded the data in an effort to keep things minimal. By the end of this post you will have the knowledge to enable you to move that data into a real database, also managed by Docker Compose.

```go
package main
import (
    "encoding/json"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

type film struct {
    Universe    string   `json:"universe"`
    Title       string   `json:"title"`
    Year 	 	int      `json:"int"`
}

var films = [...]film{
    {"Marvel", "Iron Man", 2008},
    {"DC", "The Dark Knight", 2008},
    {"Marvel", "The Avengers", 2012},
    {"DC", "Man of Steel", 2013},
    {"Marvel", "Black Panther", 2018},
    {"DC", "Justice League", 2017},
}
func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        j, _ := json.Marshal(films)
        w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
        w.Write(j)
    })
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":80", nil))
}
```

Let‚Äôs make sure everything works.

`go run api.go`

and in other terminal run

```bash
curl localhost

[{"universe":"Marvel","title":"Iron Man","int":2008},{"universe":"DC","title":"The Dark Knight","int":2008},..
```

Looks good! If you don‚Äôt have `go`installed you can skip this step and trust that it works - you‚Äôll be able to run this code in a minute via Docker anyway.

**1.2) Dockerizing the Go API**

Create another file in the api directory name Dockerfile.

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:alpine
WORKDIR /go/src/api
COPY . .
RUN go install -v ./...
CMD ["api"]
```

This Dockerfile is pretty much as simple. In short we are defining an image using the¬† `golang:alpine` base image, copying our code and running it.

When your application becomes more complex, fetching dependencies etc, this file will need to reflect those changes.

Ok, let‚Äôs try out our container using the Docker cli. Note that we‚Äôre mapping the port from 80->8091. I‚Äôm not going to explain the other flags passed to these commands, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).

```bash
~ docker build -t docker-compose-basics-api .
~ docker run -p 8091:80/tcp -it --rm docker-compose-basics-api
..
~ curl localhost:8091
[{"universe":"Marvel","title":"Iron Man","int":2008},{"universe":"DC","title":"The Dark Knight","int":2008},..
```

Great, our container works too.

_Now you can be sure the code works if you skipped it the first time. If you‚Äôre new to Docker, this demonstrates the power of it. You can run code without installing the specific compiler/runtime üëç._

### _2) Web server_

**2.1) Writing a simple web server in Node**

Go inside the `web` directory, create new file named `index.js`.

```javascript
const http = require("http");
http
  .createServer(function (req, res) {
    const content = "<p>No films.</p>";
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
    res.write(`<html><body><h1>Films</h1>${content}</body></html>`);
    res.end();
  })
  .listen(80);
```

Keeping this simple. This code will create a web server listening on port 80 which will return some HTML.

```shell
~ node index.js
..
~ curl localhost
<html><body><h1>Films</h1>No Movies.</body></html>
```

**2.2) Dockerizing the Node web server**

Next, create a `Dockerfile` in the `web` directory

```Dockerfile
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /docker-compose-basics/web
COPY . .
RUN npm install --prod
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

Let‚Äôs run it and make sure it works. Note that this image has a slightly different name and port.

```
~ docker build -t docker-compose-basics-web .
~ docker run -p 8092:80/tcp --init -it --rm docker-compose-basics-web
..
~ curl localhost:8092
<html><body><h1>Movies</h1><p>No Movies.</p></body></html>
```

Awesome, this one works too.

### 3) Creating the Docker Compose file

Finally, we‚Äôre here. Create `docker-compose.yml` in the top level directory `docker_compose_bascis`.

```Dockerfile
version: "3"
services:
  movies-api:
    build: ./api
    ports:
      - 8091:80
  movies-web:
    build: ./web
    ports:
      - 8092:80
    depends_on:
      - movies-api
```

That's it.

We‚Äôve defined two services named `movies-api` and `movies-web`. Until now we had to use `docker build` to build our images. Docker Compose handles this for us, it just needs to be pointed to the directory containing the Dockerfile. We have also exposed our ports as we did previously in `docker run`.

Also we‚Äôve introduced a new concept; `depends_on`. This tells Docker Compose that films-web depends on `movies-api`. This is especially useful when you have many services and databases. Internally this just ensures that the API is started before the web service. It does **NOT** wait for the API to be ‚Äòready‚Äô, to handle this please read the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/).

Let‚Äôs give it a try‚Ä¶ with one simple command;

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

Awesome, both services are up and running as expected;

```shell
~ curl localhost:8091
[{"universe":"Marvel","title":"Iron Man","int":2008},{"universe":"DC","title":"The Dark Knight","int":2008},..

~ curl localhost:8092
<html><body><h1>Movies</h1><p>No Movies.</p></body></html>
```

You can also run in detached mode by adding the `-d` flag. Later you can stop it by running `docker-compose down`.

### 4) Enabling service communication

We need our web server to fetch the films from the API. Hardcoding IP addresses/host names/ports in our services is far too brittle and error prone.

Fortunately, Docker Compose makes this really easy. Each service joins a common network with the name of the service defined in `docker-compose.yml` used as the hostname.

Let‚Äôs update the web server to talk to the API. Replace `index.js` with the following code;

```javascript
const http = require("http");
async function fetch(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    http
      .get(url, (res) => {
        let data = "";

        res.on("data", (chunk) => {
          data += chunk;
        });

        res.on("end", () => {
          resolve(JSON.parse(data));
        });
      })
      .on("error", (err) => {
        reject(err);
      });
  });
}
http
  .createServer(async function (req, res) {
    const movies = await fetch("http://movies-api");
    const content = movies
      .map(
        ({ universe, title, year }) =>
          `${universe} (${title}) - Released on ${year}`
      )
      .reduce((list, str) => `${list}<li>${str}</li>`, "");
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
    res.write(`<html><body><h1>Movies</h1><ul>${content}</ul></body></html>`);
    res.end();
  })
  .listen(80);
```

I‚Äôve implemented a naive `fetch()` function rather than pulling in a dependency - again keeping things simple. You‚Äôll see that we can now refer to the API using the service name defined in the Docker Compose file as the hostname; `fetch('http://movies-api')`.

The result is;

```bash
~ docker-compose up --build
..
~ curl localhost:8092
<html><body><h1>Movies</h1><ul><li>Marvel (Iron Man) - Released on 2008 ...
```

So that's it. Maybe later on I will write a tutorial for docker-compose with volumes in it.
