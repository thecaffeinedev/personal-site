This year, I had been thinking about traveling to different places across India, and Goa had always been on my list. 
Goa is a place I wanted to visit ever since my college days, but somehow, I never got the chance. 

Finally, the opportunity came up, and it all happened rather suddenly. I live in Hyderabad, so we looked into various travel options like bus, train, and flights. Eventually, we chose to fly as it was the most convenient for us.

- **Trip Details:**
    - **Dates:** April 26 to April 29, 2024
    - **Mode of Transport:** Flight (Hyderabad to Goa, approx. ₹5300 per person for a round trip)
    - **Stay:** First night in Anjuna, then Zostel Morjim
    - **Scooty Rental:** Yamaha Fascino 125, approx. ₹400-500 per day

#### Day 1: Arrival in Goa (April 26, 2024)

We flew to Goa on the evening of April 26th and reached Dabolim Airport around 12:30 AM. Since it was late, we looked for a hotel to stay for the night and found one in Anjuna. We booked a cab using the Goa Miles app as there were no Uber or Ola services available, which cost around ₹1600.


#### Day 2: Anjuna to Morjim (April 27, 2024)

The next morning, we explored Anjuna Beach, which was quiet and almost empty at 7:30 AM. After a peaceful morning by the beach and a delicious breakfast (pancakes, juices, tea, and scrambled eggs), we headed to our next stop, Zostel Morjim. After checking in, we rented a scooty to explore North Goa for the next two days.

We had lunch at a local restaurant called Goan Kitchen, which was absolutely delicious! The food was so good that we ended up coming back for dinner later that day. In the afternoon, we took some rest because it was quite sunny, and later in the evening, we spent time at Morjim Beach, which had a nice, relaxed vibe.


#### Day 3: North Goa Exploration (April 28, 2024)

We started the day early with a visit to Arambol Beach. It was very peaceful as it was still early and most places were closed. We walked about 1.5 km to reach Sweet Water Lake, where we took a refreshing dip and enjoyed the surrounding nature. Afterward, we had breakfast by the beach.

Next, we visited the famous Aguada Fort in Candolim, about 30 km from Arambol. Although the fort was crowded and the food there wasn’t great, it was still nice to explore. We returned to Morjim in the afternoon and, once again, had an amazing meal at Goan Kitchen. In the evening, we walked around Morjim Beach, enjoying the cool breeze and quiet surroundings.


#### Day 4: Last Day in Goa (April 29, 2024)

On our final day, we had breakfast at Udupi Morjim before heading out to Querim Beach, which is the northernmost beach in Goa. The ride there was scenic, and the beach itself was almost empty except for a few foreigners. We decided to try some water sports, including scuba diving, though the water wasn’t very clear, so the experience was just okay.

After spending some time at Querim, we returned for lunch at Goan Kitchen (again!), freshened up at Zostel, and packed up for our return flight to Hyderabad, which was at 9 PM.

#### Final Thoughts

Although the trip was short, I thoroughly enjoyed exploring North Goa. We missed out on some places due to time constraints, but I found a new love for pancakes and crepes during this trip! I’m definitely planning to visit again as Goa’s peaceful beaches and tasty food left me wanting more.
