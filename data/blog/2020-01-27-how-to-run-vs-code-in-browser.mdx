I have been into this programming field since my college days and I have tried a lot of editors over time. As a developer, I believe a code editor is one of the most important tool that a developer can have.

Before I was happy with Sublime Text and Atom for most of the part because it could do everything I needed in my tech stack.

I switched to VS Code for the following reasons:

1. **Git integration**: I actually prefer to use Terminal for anything to do with Git but the VS Code git system is really great.
2. **Integrated terminals**: You get a complete terminal emulator, out of the box.
3. **Speed & Extensions:** VS Code is not as fast as Sublime Text but it feels faster than Atom. It has thousands of extensions available that cover pretty much every use case I can think of.
4. **IntelliSense:** Intellisense is incredible.VS Code has more intelligent language support, autocompletion, and suggestion. It’s super helpful, sometimes I don’t have to look up various functions and methods.
5. **Completely Free:** It is open source and updates are very much frequent.

And there’s more.

Anyway, this blog post is about how to run VS Code in your browser. I am using Ubuntu 18.04 btw. Ubuntu 20.04 will also work fine.

First go to this URL

https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/tag/2.1698 and download the binary file for Linux.

Then unzip it.

Then go inside the unzipped folder.

Inside that folder, the code-server is the binary file and you can run it by

```
./code-server
```

As you can see it’s running on my localhost.

If you want your own password, you can add your own password by

```
PASSWORD=prabhat ./code-server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

You can change your port if you want to.

Then you have to go to your local address. In my case it’s

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

It will ask you to enter your password.

After entering your password, you will see your code server up and running.

So that’s it.

I do use the desktop based VSCode for day-to-day coding purpose. But sometimes when needed, running VS code on my browsers saves me time and makes me more productive.

And I think a code editor is simply a tool. It doesn’t matter whether you choose Sublime Text or VS Code or any other. What matters is it works for you.
