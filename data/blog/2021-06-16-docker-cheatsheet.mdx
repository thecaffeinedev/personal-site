# Docker Cheatsheet

## Basics

### Dockerfile

A text file that contains all commands, in order, needed to build a given image. A Dockerfile adheres to a specific format and set of instructions which you can find at [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). You can also find common [Best Practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/) on the official website.

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-alpine
RUN mkdir /app
ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Multi-stage builds

With [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/), you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you donâ€™t want in the final image.

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx

EXPOSE 8000

COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
```

### .dockerignore

To exclude files not relevant to the build use a [dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file) file.

```
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
env
pip-log.txt
pip-delete-this-directory.txt
.coverage.*
.cache
coverage.xml
*.cover
*.log
.mypy_cache
.pytest_cache
.hypothesis
```

## Images

An [image](https://docs.docker.com/language/nodejs/build-images/) is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application - the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

```
docker build .                          # Build image
docker build -t <image>:<tag> .         # Build image with tag
```

```
docker images -a                        # List all images on this machine
docker image rm <image>                 # Remove image from this machine
```

## Containers

A [container](https://docs.docker.com/language/nodejs/run-containers/) is a runtime instance of an image - what the image becomes in memory when executed.

```
docker create -t <image>                # Create container
docker start -i <container>             # Start container
docker run -it <image>                  # Create and start container
```

```
docker ps -a                            # Show all running containers
docker container ls -a                  # Show all containers

docker stop <container>                 # Gracefully stop the container
docker kill <container>                 # Force shutdown of the container
docker rm <container>                   # Remove container from this machine
```

## Utility

```
# Remove all unused containers, networks and images
docker system prune

# Remove all unused volumes
docker volume prune

# Stop all running containers
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

# Delete all stopped containers
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

## Debug

```
docker logs <container>
docker exec -it <container> <command>
```

## Volumes

### Host volumes/Bind Mounts

Use bind mounts to give your container access to your source code. The physical host file system is mounted into the virtual file system. Changes are propagated back to the Docker host.

```
docker run -v /home/caffeinedev/work:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

### Anonymous Volumes

The location of anonymous volumes is managed by Docker. Note that it can be difficult to refer to the same volume when it is anonymous. Anonymous volumes have no specific source so when the container is deleted, instruct the Docker Engine daemon to remove them.

```
docker run -v /var/lib/postgresql/data
```

### Named volumes

Named volumes can be referred to by specific names.

```
docker run -v data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

## Configuration

For production, use secrets to store sensitive application data used by services, and use configs for non-sensitive data such as configuration files.

```
docker config create
docker secret create
```

## Docker-Compose

[Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

### Basics

```
docker-compose up                     # Create and start one or more containers
docker-compose up -d                  # Don't show terminal
docker-compose up --build             # Force rebuilding
docker-compose up --force-recreate    # Force recreate

docker-compose -f docker-compose.override.yml up

docker-compose down
docker-compose ps -a
```

Docker-compose is a whole different topic to talk about. Maybe I will write a different blog post for it.
