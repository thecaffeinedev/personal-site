## Introduction

Recently, I had the pleasure of embarking on a memorable **3-day trip to Kodaikanal**, a beautiful hill station nestled in the **Palani Hills of Tamil Nadu, India**. Despite the limited information available online, my companion and I managed to explore many stunning locations and had some unexpected adventures along the way. This blog post will take you through our journey, day by day, sharing our experiences and the breathtaking sights we encountered.

## Day 1: Arrival and First Impressions

We arrived in Kodaikanal early in the morning, at around **8 AM**. The first thing that struck us was the **chilly weather**. Even though it was summer, the cool mountain air caught us by surprise, and we found ourselves wishing we had packed warmer clothes. It was a refreshing change from the heat we had left behind in the plains.

Our hotel was located about **2 kilometers from the Kodaikanal bus stand**, and check-in time wasn't until **11 AM**. As we pondered our options, a friendly cab driver approached us at the bus stand. He explained that **private cabs were the primary mode of transportation** for tourists in Kodaikanal, as there were no auto-rickshaws or other local transport options readily available. We decided to take him up on his offer to drive us to our hotel for **₹300**.

While waiting to check in early at the hotel, we inquired about our options for exploring the local attractions. We learned that our choices were limited to either hiring a private cab or taking a shared mini-bus. Given our unfamiliarity with the area, we opted for a private cab and contacted the same driver who had brought us to the hotel. He offered various day-tour packages, and we chose one for **₹2500** that covered **5-6 places**.

After settling in, having breakfast at the resort, and freshening up, we set out around **11:30 AM** to start our exploration. Our first stop was **Coaker's Walk**, a beautiful man-made walking plaza built on the mountains in **1872**. The **one-kilometer walkway** offered panoramic views of the valley below, taking our breath away with its beauty.

From there, we visited **La Saleth Church**, the oldest church in Kodaikanal, with a history spanning about **150 years**. The architecture and peaceful atmosphere were truly impressive.

Our next adventure took us to **Vattakanal**, where we embarked on a moderate **3-kilometer trek** to the famous **Dolphin's Nose viewpoint**. The unique rock formation, resembling a dolphin's snout, was accidentally discovered by the British in the **1800s**. The trek through the pines and rocks of the Palani Hill Range was exhilarating, and the views from the top were well worth the effort.

After our trek, we treated ourselves to a meal at the famous **Altaf's Cafe** before exploring the nearby **Vattakanal Waterfalls**. The sound of rushing water and the cool mist were incredibly refreshing after our hike.

Returning to the main Kodaikanal city, we visited **Bryant Park**, a beautiful botanical garden spanning over **20 acres**. The park, set up in **1908**, boasts a wide variety of flora and is a testament to the region's rich biodiversity.

Our final stop for the day was **Kodaikanal Lake**. Although it was crowded due to the summer season, we enjoyed a pleasant walk around the lake, taking in the serene atmosphere and watching boaters glide across the water.

As evening approached, our cab driver dropped us near our hotel. After freshening up, we ventured out again to explore the city and find dinner. We also took this opportunity to search for a hotel closer to the main city area for our remaining nights. During our evening exploration, we discovered a shared traveler van option for sightseeing, which seemed like a good deal at **₹800-900 for two people**. We decided to give it a try for the next day's adventures.

## Day 2: Exploring the Outskirts

Our second day began with a change of accommodation. We checked out of our original hotel and moved to the new one we had found the previous evening, which was more conveniently located. After settling in, we made our way to the common pickup point for our shared traveler van tour.

The van was filled with other tourists, creating a lively atmosphere. Our guide for the day provided interesting commentary and historical information about the places we visited. Our first stop was the **Observatory Pine Forest**, where we spent some time taking in the serene beauty and capturing photos among the tall, straight pine trees.

Next, we visited the **Palani Temple View Point**, which offered a stunning vista of the surrounding landscape. Nearby, we also explored a small **Mahalakshmi temple**, adding a touch of spiritual significance to our journey.

One of the highlights of the day was the **Poombarai Village View**. From this vantage point, we could see the entire village spread out below us, with its patchwork of fields and traditional houses creating a picturesque scene.

Our journey then took us to the **Mannavanur Sheep Farm** and **Mannavanur Lake**. The lake view was particularly breathtaking, surrounded by lush hills and forests. Although we didn't participate in activities like horse riding or zip-lining due to time constraints, we thoroughly enjoyed the natural beauty of the area and captured plenty of photos and videos to remember the moment.

The final stop of our tour was **Poombarai Village** itself, where we visited the **Kuzhandhai Velappar temple**. This ancient temple, said to be **3000 years old**, was originally built by the **Chera dynasty** and is dedicated to **Lord Muruga**. The historical significance and architectural beauty of the temple left a lasting impression on us.

After a full day of sightseeing, we returned to Kodaikanal city for a late lunch. The evening was spent relaxing at our hotel and then venturing out again to explore more of the city. We enjoyed some delicious momos at **Wok at Skydeck**, followed by dinner at a local restaurant. We also did some shopping, picking up chocolates and souvenirs to remember our trip by.

## Day 3: Last-Minute Sightseeing

Our final day in Kodaikanal was a bit of a whirlwind. We had a bus to catch from **Dindigul** (about **2-3 hours away** from Kodaikanal) at **7:30 PM**, so we needed to wrap up our sightseeing by early afternoon. After a quick breakfast and packing our belongings, we hired a cab for **₹2500** to take us on a last-minute tour of the remaining sights.

Our first stop was the **Upper Lake View**, which provided a spectacular panoramic view of Kodaikanal Lake from above. The morning light cast a beautiful glow over the landscape, making for some stunning photographs.

Next, we visited the **Rose Garden**, a beautiful park spread over **10 acres**. The garden is home to **1600 varieties of flowers**, including some of the rarest and most exquisite rose varieties. The colors and fragrances were truly captivating, and we wished we had more time to spend there.

Our journey continued to **Moir Point**, a beautiful viewpoint situated on the **Ten Mile Round Road**. Named after **Sir Thomas Moir**, a 19th-century collector of Madurai district, this spot offered breathtaking views of the valley below and the surrounding hills.

We then made a quick stop at the **Pine Forest** for a short walk and some photos before heading to the famous **Guna Caves**. Also known as **Devil's Kitchen**, these caves have gained recent popularity due to their appearance in the Malayalam movie **"Manjummel Boys"**. Although trekking in the caves is now banned due to safety concerns, the site still holds a mysterious allure.

Our tour continued with a visit to **Pillar Rocks**, where we admired the beautiful rock formations and explored the nearby small parks and shopping areas. Our final stops were **Green Valley View** (also known as **Suicide Point**) and the **Golf Course**, both offering their unique perspectives on Kodaikanal's natural beauty.

After a quick lunch, we rushed to catch our bus to Dindigul. We faced some challenges finding our pickup point due to language barriers, but with the help of a kind auto-rickshaw driver, we eventually made it to the correct location and boarded our bus back home.
